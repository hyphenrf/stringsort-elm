## Stringsort

This is a single simple function that's missing from the String module in the
core lib.

To use:
	import String.Sort exposing (sort)
	sort "Your String Here"

and that should return:
	"  HSYeeginorrrtu"

That's a good question. I wrote this hoping it'd be faster since I don't have
to convert to another type. I was wrong. It turned out to be 3x slower after I
ran the benchmarks. Ironically. Do not actually use this code. It was more of
a personal exercise. Maybe another exercise for another day is figuring out
where it chokes and trying to optimize it..

Update: of course it is ineffecient; this is a copy of haskell's demo which is
admittedly elegant, but also very ineffecient. What makes quicksort 'quick' is
the fact that it updates the array inplace. something that isn't practical with
lists or the way data structures are handled in this implementation
