## Stringsort

This is a single simple function that's missing from the String module in the
core lib.

To use:
	import String.Sort exposing (sort)
	sort "Your String Here"

and that should return:
	"  HSYeeginorrrtu"

That's a good question. I wrote this hoping it'd be faster since I don't have
to convert to another type. I was wrong. It turned out to be 3x slower after I
ran the benchmarks. Ironically. Do not actually use this code. It was more of
a personal exercise. Maybe another exercise for another day is figuring out
where it chokes and trying to optimize it..
